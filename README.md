# Front End Web Development

## Welcome

Welcome to Flatiron School’s Intro to Front End Web Development. We’re
delighted that you have chosen to learn with us. In this part-time
course, you’ll learn the fundamentals of front-end web development &mdash;
including including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style
Sheets), and programming with JavaScript.

Whether your goal is to build a website, style an email newsletter or 
collaborate with developers, this course will ensure you not only gain the 
power to _read others' code_, you gain the insight to _create it on your own_.

## Preparation

No prior experience is required. You _do_ need to sign up for an account with
[GitHub][] and [Learn][], though. Be sure to bring an open mind as well!

## Syllabus

### Section 1: Command Line, Intro HTML

Begin the course by working in command-line environment (CLI) and learning to
write valid HTML.

### Section 2: Forms, Input Fields, Basic Styling

Section 2 expands on how to use HTML tags in order to create input fields with
forms, pulling data from other sites via `<iframe>` (Inline Frame), and
embedding media. We'll also learn about separation of content from presentation,
element targeting for CSS, and basic styling.

### Section 3: Advanced Layouts, Flexbox, CSS Grid

We learned to style basic pages in Section 2. Now learn advanced types of layout
so that sites look great on tablets, phones, and desktops.  We'll use the
"flexbox" and "CSS grid" techniques to make this happen.

### Section 4: Project 1

Section 4 serves as a chance to review what we've learned to this point and to
complete the first portfolio project: a hosted site with a responsive
presentation based on screen size (i.e. mobile device, tablet, or computer).

### Section 5: Introducing JavaScript, DOM

Section 5 will introduce JavaScript (the language of the browser) and the DOM
(Document-Object Model). We'll train up on our basic programming skills:

* Declaring and assigning variables
* Making decisions
* Repeating steps
* Declaring and running functions

These skills will be required to utilize JavaScript but are common to
_all_ programming languages.

### Section 6: More JavaScript, DOM, Version Control (git)

In Section 6 we'll practice using JavaScript as a general programming
language. We'll take the next step and learn to work with Objects and
Arrays. These are data types that contain _other_ data types. We will
use the DOM skills from Section 5 to display the data contained in Arrays
and Objects. We'll also learn how developers keep track of their work 
using the git Version Control System and collaborate with others using 
GitHub.

### Section 7: Eventing

The browser is an event-based environment: clicking, scrolling, etc. To respond
to those events, we'll need to learn about how JavaScript handles events. We'll
learn to update the screen by linking events to screen updates.

### Section 8: AJAX, Third Party Data

What is it that creates the "infinite scroll"? Somehow browsers know how to
seamlessly fetch data to keep the experience fast and pretty. The tool to
accomplish this is "AJAX" and we'll be exploring it this section.

### Section 9: Begin Project 2

In Section 9, we'll integrate all the material learned in the previous sections and
begin making a final project that unites page structure in HTML, style in
CSS, and provides fast feedback with JavaScript.

In the final section of the course, we'll finish building the second project,
which will be viewable on [GitHub][].
